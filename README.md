# Email Spam Classification

Spam messages are illegal or unwanted messages that are sent to a large number of users. Its primary goal is to entice or entice users into clicking on malicious links or downloading malicious attachments. So, to prevent this I created a ML model for detecting spam messages. When spam detected in Text, it improves the user experience by preventing spam messages from entering the user's inbox.
